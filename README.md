## FEATURES

At this first version the api is as well consumed. It returns every country with its details. By clicking on each flag the applications is going to render more information about the country. 90% of the application can change between light and dark mood.

## ISSUES TO SOLVE

According to the requeriments from frontmentor, the styles are not yet optimized as well. The flags doesn't size harmonically. The country's view also doesn't match with the mockup.

Taking in account its functionality, the search input is so slowly to render, the region filter is not working, the code is just documented by its variables and functions and it most be refactored. In the country view there is a biggest issue to solve with the dark mood, it crashes!
